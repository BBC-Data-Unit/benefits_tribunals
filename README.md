In September 2021, the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58284613) seven out of ten people who appealed in court against a decision to deny them disability benefits were successful.

In total, more than 293,000 people across the UK had overturned a government decision at tribunal in the previous three years.

Most hearings centred on Personal Independence Payment (PIP), the main disability benefit.

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said it made millions of PIP decisions and 5% were overturned.

Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act also revealed more than 1,000 people across the UK had died while formally challenging their benefit decision.

In July 2021 [we had reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57726608) how the DWP had held at least 268 internal reviews into cases where people claiming benefits died or came to serious harm since February 2012. The Labour Party then called for an "urgent independent investigation".

## Method

We analysed figures from from HM Courts and Tribunals Service, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and Northern Ireland's Department for Communities (DfC).

Our analysis found:

- In England, Scotland and Wales, seven in every 10 tribunal appeals about benefits had been successful since 2018
- Over the same period, some 500 people died before their initial challenge, their Mandatory Reconsideration, was decided
- A further 421 tribunal cases in England, Scotland and Wales were abated (progress halted) because the appellant died and no appointee had yet been found to continue appeals
- In Northern Ireland, six out of every 10 appeals were successful since 2019. Sixty appeals had been lodged on behalf of people who died since 2013
